		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p> I have been to Pittsburgh twice now and it is one of my favorite cities. They have very impressive architecture and lots of skyscapers! They have a great food scene and lots of natural beauty such as hills, mountains, and rivers all going right through the city. I have been to a Pittsburgh Pirates game and they have one of the best views of any balklpark in the entire country. It is a city I look to go back to soon.  </p>

		<p> Here is a list of top 3 things to do if you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Explore downtown and art district</li>
			<li>The Duquesne Incline</li>
			<li>Pirate's Game</li>
		</ol>
