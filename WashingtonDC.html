		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p style="font-size: larger;">I went to Washington DC last summer and it was a blast! We took a road trip to DC and stopped in Pittsburgh on the way there. We ended up staying in a very unique house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is within walking distance of everything. We went to lots of museums, monuments and saw a lot of history! The food scene and public transportation was also great and I look to go back again soon.  </p>
