		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p> I went on my Hawaii trip over the summer and has a blast. We stayed on Maui, but traveled to the island of Lanai as well, by boat. We stayed in Lahaina, a small beach town on the western coast of the island of Maui and were within walking distance of the beautiful beaches. We did lots of hiking, swimming, sightseeing and went on a trip through and around a mountain. It was my favorite trip of all time!  </p>

		<p> Here is a list of top 3 things to do if you ever find yourself in Maui!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Road to Hana</li>
			<li>Boat Ride to Lanai</li>
			<li>Go to literally any beach/hike anywhere</li>
		</ol>
