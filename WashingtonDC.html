		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p> I went to Washington DC last summer and it was a blast! We took a road trip to DC and stopped in Pittsburgh on the way there. We ended up staying in a very unique house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is within walking distance of everything. We went to lots of museums, monuments and saw a lot of history! The food scene and public transportation was also great and I look to go back again soon.  </p>

		<p> Here is a list of top 3 things to do if you ever find yourself in Washington DC!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Visit the National Mall</li>
			<li>Go to Smithsonian Museum</li>
			<li>National's Game</li>
		</ol>
